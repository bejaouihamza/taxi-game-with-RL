<h2>Mastering Reinforcement Learning with the Atari Taxi Game</h2>

<p>In my latest project, I developed a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to play the classic Atari game <em>Taxi</em> using OpenAI's Gym library. This project serves as a practical demonstration of how reinforcement learning can be applied to solve complex decision-making problems.</p>

<h3>The Core of the Project: The Bellman Equation</h3>

<p>At the heart of this project is the Bellman equation, which plays a pivotal role in the Q-learning algorithm. The equation is expressed as:</p>

<p><code>Q(s, a) = r + γ · max(Q(s', a'))</code></p>

<p>Here’s a brief breakdown:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Q(s, a):</strong> The expected reward for taking action <code>a</code> in state <code>s</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>r:</strong> The immediate reward received after taking action <code>a</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>γ:</strong> The discount factor, representing the importance of future rewards.</li>
  <li><strong>max(Q(s', a')):</strong> The maximum expected future reward for the next state.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using this approach, the algorithm learns the best strategies for the <em>Taxi</em> game by maximizing cumulative rewards over time.</p>
