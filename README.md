<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>This project involves developing a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to play the Atari game <em>Taxi</em> using OpenAI's Gym library. The Bellman equation, <code>Q(s, a) = r + γ ⋅ max(Q(s', a'))</code>, is central to the Q-learning approach implemented in this project.</p>

<p>I'm grateful to the <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/">deeplearning.ai</a> course on "Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, and Reinforcement," which was instrumental in helping me achieve this project.</p>
